# Page Ranking Algorithms

This project implements and analyzes graph-based page ranking algorithms commonly used in search engines, including PageRank and HITS.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **PageRank** using the Power Iteration method
- **HITS (Hubs and Authorities)** algorithm
- Topic-sensitive ranking concepts

## Key Concepts
- Graph-based ranking and link analysis
- Eigenvector computation and convergence
- Spider traps and dead ends in web graphs
- Numerical stability in iterative methods
